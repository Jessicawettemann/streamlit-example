    # Display user message in chat message container

The only difference so far is we've changed the title of our app and added imports for random and time. We'll use random to randomly select a response from a list of responses and time to add a delay to simulate the chatbot "thinking" before responding.

All that's left to do is add the chatbot's responses within the if block. We'll use a list of responses and randomly select one to display. We'll also add a delay to simulate the chatbot "thinking" before responding (or stream its response). Let's make a helper function for this and insert it at the top of our app.

# Streamed response emulator
def response_generator():
    response = random.choice(
        [
            "Hello there! How can I assist you today?",
            "Hi, human! Is there anything I can help you with?",
            "Do you need help?",
        ]
    )
    for word in response.split():
        yield word + " "
        time.sleep(0.05)
